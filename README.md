## Getting Started

To set up and run this project, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the `stock-simulation` directory:**
   ```bash
   cd stock-simulation

2. **Install the necessary dependencies (make sure Node.js and npm are installed):**

   npm install

3. **Add an API Key from Polygon.io:**
   This project requires an API key from [Polygon.io](https://polygon.io/) to fetch stock data.

   * Sign up at Polygon.io and obtain API key.
   * Create a file named .env in the stock-simulation directory.
   * Add API key to the .env file like this:
     ```bash
     EXPO_PUBLIC_ENV=api_key_here
   *NOT MADE FOR DEPLOYMENT*

5. **Start the Expo development server:**
   ```bash
   npx expo start

This will install all required packages and start the Expo development server, allowing you to run the application on your local machine or connected device.
